The first paragraph should include the following:

Describe the purpose, or the reason, you did this assignment.
How did you analyze the data to create the technical deliverables?
What can be said about the summary DataFrame and multiple-line graph with respect to the ride-sharing data among the different city types? Include images of the summary DataFrame table and the multiple-line graph in these results.
A short summary of the results.
The second paragraph should include the following:

What challenges or difficulties did you encounter? If none, then briefly explain what challenges or difficulties may be encountered and how to avoid them using technical analysis.
Explain how you overcame any challenges or difficulties, and include what technical analysis you use to overcome the challenges or difficulties.
The third paragraph should include the following:

Based on the data from the different city types, what recommendations would you give the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types?
Provide two additional analyses you could do to gain more insight into the data, like using other datasets.
What technical steps would you take to perform the additional analyses?

## Purpose Statement & Results:

The purpose of this challenge was to merge and analyze two datasets generated by a ride sharing app, PyBer, in order to generate meaningful takeaways centered around the type of city -- rural, suburban, or urban. This type of analysis can help PyBer determine markets where they would like to expand, as well as to understand the needs of their customers in various geographic locations.

## Challenges & Difficulties:



---

## Recommendations:

1) using ride duration/distance (min, mi) data to determine which city type has the longer rides, and fare per minute or fare per mile.

2) using passenger age to determine demographic of users in each city type.
